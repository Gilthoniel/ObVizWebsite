                <strong>ObViz Account.</strong> Your ObViz account or using the Service with a social media account gives you access to the services and
                functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts
                for different types of Users. If you open a ObViz account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you
                and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity

                for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords

            <h3>User Responsibility and User-Posted Content</h3>
            <p>
                Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content such as profile information, comments, questions, and other content or
                information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service “User Content”).<br>
                You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death,
                disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of

                any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law
                or of another party’s trade secrets); or (vi) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available
                under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not
                violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below), rights of
                privacy or publicity rights. To the extent that your User Content contains music, you hereby represent that you are the owner of all
                the copyright rights, including without limitation the performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and

                exception and have the power to grant the license granted below. ObViz reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or
                remove any User Content that ObViz believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. You understand that publishing your
                User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America,
                or any other rights organization.<br>
                For the purposes of the Terms, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights,

                property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals
                and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.<br>
                In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following: Your User Content and ObViz’ use thereof
                as contemplated by these Terms and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including
                but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights, right of publicity and privacy rights.<br>
                ObViz may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under these Terms without liability for payment of any guild fees,
                residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.<br>
                ObViz takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts
                or sends over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or
                publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of
                your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable,
                inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that ObViz shall not be liable for any

                By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights
                necessary to grant, to ObViz a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide
                license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly
                perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as
                contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter
                developed, for use in connection with the Service and ObViz’ (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including
                without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any

            <h3>Publisher Responsibility and Content Guidelines</h3>
            <p>
                ObViz enables online discussion communities, and in doing so, freedom of expression and identity are core values of the
                Service. There are a number of categories of content and behavior, however, that jeopardize the Service by posing risk
                to users, publishers or third party services utilizing the ObViz platform. Websites or website representatives publishing
                inappropriate content or exhibiting inappropriate behaviors in connection with their use of the Service, including
                from the following categories, may have their ObViz account suspended or terminated:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blackmail or extortion</li>
                <li>Copyright or trademark Infringement</li>
                <li>Deceitful data collection</li>
                <li>Harm to minors or animals</li>
                <li>Impersonation</li>
                <li>Intimidation of users of the ObViz Service</li>
                <li>Malware</li>
                <li>Privacy violations</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                The above list may be modified or expanded at any time, and individual account deactivation decisions remain at the sole discretion of ObViz.
            </p>

            <h3>Feeds and API</h3>
            <p>
                ObViz provides access to portions of its Service via RSS feeds and an API; for the purposes of these Terms, such access
                constitutes use of the Service. ObViz asks that you use these features respectfully, and as may be outlined in any
                documentation that we provide. You may not use these or any other features of the Service itself to allow the display of
                a substantial portion of the ObViz database or reproduce, duplicate or copy any or all of the ObViz Service. ObViz
                reserves the right to change these features at any time and to disable access to the feeds and the API at any time for
                any reason or no reason.
            </p>

                The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in Switzerland. ObViz makes no representations

                Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance
                with all applicable Swiss and local laws and regulations.

            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                ObViz (“ObViz,” “we,” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures
                regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of information that apply to our Service, as well
                as your choices regarding the collection and use of information.
            </p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                ObViz is a free service that enables controversy understanding and debates within online communities
                and discussion. We fully support freedom of speech.
            </p>

            <h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
            <p>
                To use the ObViz service, an email address, username and password are required, or log in using social
                media accounts. We use personally identifiable information to deliver the Service, to comply with
                reasonable requests of law enforcement and recommend additional content to you, some of which may include
                content from advertisers.
            </p>

            <h4>Advertising</h4>
            <p>
                While today ObViz does not make money, we might, at some point in the future, be paid by advertisers to serve content.
            </p>

            <h4>Censorship</h4>
            <p>
                ObViz does not moderate comments neither on ObViz.com nor on the sites that use our service. If a comment
                you make is deleted or not posted, it is done so at the discretion of that site operator. Each community
                using ObViz establishes their own standards for etiquette and acceptable language.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Collection on the Site</h3>
            <p>
                Our Service allows for an interactive experience by integrating a commenting platform. By using our Service
                you understand and agree that we are providing a public comment sharing platform and that we or other Users
                may search for, see, use, re-post any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the
                Service. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our
                Terms of Use.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>: We collect information that can be used to identify
                you as an individual (“Personally Identifiable Information”) only when you provide such information directly
                to us in connection with the Service. We ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and
                e-mail address when you register for a ObViz account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in
                which case we will also retain our responses). We may also retain any messages you send through the Service,
                and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We may receive Personally
                Identifiable Information about you from third parties, including, for example, information about your
                transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use
                of certain applications. For example, if you access our website or Service through a third-party connection
                or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” linking your account to the
                ObViz service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to ObViz.
                This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, any
                information you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public
                in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings
                on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to ObViz’ website or Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>: We also collect and use information about your
                interactions with the Service in a manner and format that does not identify you as an individual
                (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). We may collect, use, and disclose Non-Personally Identifiable
                Information as set forth below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cookies Information</strong>: Like many websites, when you visit the Service, we may send one or
                more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that
                uniquely identifies your browser and lets ObViz help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through
                the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you
                view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of
                the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
                Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be
                removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you
                close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
                being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies
                is disabled.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Analytics Information</strong>: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and
                usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page
                request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other
                information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in
                aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Log File Information</strong>: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each
                time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file
                information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
                (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with
                links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Collection on Partner Sites</h3>
            <p>
                We may receive and collect information from users of third party sites which use the ObViz service
                ("Partner Sites") about you and your usage of the ObViz Service on their sites. Unless you have allowed
                the Partner Site to share Personally Identifiable Information, such information will not include Personally
                Identifiable Information, but may include Non-Personally Identifiable Information and/or report anonymous
                information about your usage of the Partner Site and the ObViz Service on that site.
            </p>

            <h3>How We Use and Share Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Use</strong>: We use Personally Identifiable Information for the following purposes: (i) internally
                for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems or
                maintaining security, (ii) to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the
                Service, (iii) to fulfill requests you may make to us, (iv) to personalize your experience and (v) to
                provide you with information and offers that we believe you may find useful or interesting, including
                newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information on services and products offered by
                us or third parties. Following termination or deactivation of your ObViz account, ObViz may retain your
                profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit
                purposes. Furthermore, ObViz may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User
                Content) contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the
                Service after termination or deactivation of your ObViz account. ObViz reserves the right, but has no
                obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the Service. We reserve the right to remove any such
                information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion
                such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Service, or to
                protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. ObViz also reserves the right to
                remove information upon the request of any third party.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sharing</strong>: We will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third

                    Personally Identifiable Information with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing
                    the Service to you. Those business partners will be given limited access to the Personally Identifiable
                    Information that is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and we will require that such third
                    parties comply with this Privacy Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Who you may choose to share your User Content with</strong>: Any Personally Identifiable
                    Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content,

            </ul>

                <strong>Instances where we are required to share your Personally Identifiable Information</strong>: ObViz
                will disclose Personally Identifiable Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we
                reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests
                of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our terms of service or to protect the security or integrity of our
                Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ObViz, our Users
                or others.<br>

                ObViz recognizes the following guiding principles for any required sharing of information to third parties:
                a) freedom of expression and identity choice are core to the ObViz platform and should be respected as such,
                b) law enforcement requests must comply with all laws, particularly those protecting user information, and
                must clearly establish the legal need for disclosure, c) law enforcement requests must be related to
                specific investigations and specific accounts implicated in those investigations, d) whenever legally
                permitted, and barring exceptional circumstances where safety or other factors are deemed a reasonable
                counteracting concern, Users should receive notice that their specific information is being requested with
                opportunity to inquire further or contest such requests.

                <strong>Use</strong>: We may use and disclose non-personally identifiable information for any number of
                reasons and with any number of third parties, including in order to monitor and analyze use of the Site
                and our services and for the Site’s technical administration, to diagnose or fix technology problems
                reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses, to increase our Site’s
                functionality and user-friendliness, to better tailor it to your needs, to generate and derive useful data

                <strong>Sharing</strong>: We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including information
                obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such
                as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) in any
                manner permitted for Personally Identifiable Information; (ii) with our third-party business partners for
                use in anonymous advertising targeting; (iii) for the purposes described in the section above. We may also

            <h2>Ads on ObViz.com</h2>
            <p>
                We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data
                relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may
                be of interest to you. ObViz may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the
                Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or
                mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP
                address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device
                identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or
                device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
                personalize the advertising content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that an advertiser may ask ObViz to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on
                demographics or other interests). In that situation, ObViz determines the target audience and ObViz serves
                the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you
                respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience
                they are trying to reach.

                to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your
                privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your
                identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
                your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from
                ObViz, at all times. Notwithstanding the foregoing measures, ObViz cannot ensure or warrant the security
                of any information you transmit to ObViz or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed,
                disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality
                of ObViz’ distributors, such as social networks. ObViz is not responsible for the functionality or security
                measures of any third party.

            <h2>Policy Toward Children</h2>
            <p>
                This Site is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information
                from children under 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an account. If you are under 13,
                please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or
                email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on ObViz. In the
                event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without
                verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe
                that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@@obviz.com.
