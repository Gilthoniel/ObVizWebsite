    comment: "Love this game, but doesn\'t matter how many spiderwebs I go through, how many bananas I collect, they don\'t get reflected in google play achievements. I want to increase my level, but currently I can\'t. Is it your fault or google\'s? Please fix the problem, I would definitely change to 5 stars."

    title: "Fun but frustrating"
    comment: "I love these kind of run games, and this one has a lot of good elements to it. It is difficult to control though. The actions for up is just tap, so you end up jumping when you don\'t want to. It\'s also too short a swipe for down so you end up doing that when trying to glide. Nothing too bad, but it adds up to a pretty frustrating experience after a while."

    title: "Good game, lost stars for data loss."
    comment: "I love this game. Its excellent and it reminds me of my childhood, growing up with Mario and Donkey Kong. It\'s fun for kids and adults. The boar is by far my favorite. However, I recently restored my phone and figured since it logs me into Google every time I load the game, all progress would be saved. Boy was I wrong. I lost EVERYTHING. And this game can really lag sometimes. And speaking on behalf of all players, stop the ads. Or at least give us the option of viewing and earning free bananas. Slow down!!"

    comment: "Wtf just happened? I took the Doritos survey that was supposed to give me 2062 bananas but instead, my game was reset to the beginning of time! Wiped clean. Lost all my upgrades, bananas, distances... I love this game but very disappointed and frustrated at this. I want my upgrades, bananas and everything back!!!!"

    title: "Great game but some bugs..."
    comment: "When you dash (above the trees), no more platforms appear and you\'re forced to fall down. After hitting lava underground and being thrown back to the jungle, if you accidentally press down during this, you die. When riding the pelican, you can\'t dash at all and the pile of bananas catches up with you quickly."
