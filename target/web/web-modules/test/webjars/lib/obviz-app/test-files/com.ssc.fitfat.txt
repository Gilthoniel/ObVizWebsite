    comment: "What the hell is up with the swiming level? How do ypu swim if there is multiple beach balls in each lane with no opening to zig zag through. It has done this almost everytime and I lose automatically.  What is the game designed to cheat you out of you energy. Scoring is unrealistic & almost impossible.  Really A isn\'t good enough there has to be extreme S level to unlock the skinny levels. Why not make it where you have beginner (C),  intermediate (B), advanced (A), & expert (S) so player can work through"

    comment: "LOOOOL the funniest app you will download, but it has too many ads and its getting anoying. Also it needs an update for earning more coin. If you have so many ads why im going to pay for coins? Make something that if someone buys coins it will get the a \"ad-free\" version or something like that."

    comment: "It\'s not even fun for people with anger problems...it gets super annoying and I haven\'t had it that long so...if u think about getting this game well think again you need to waist your time and effort into something else because this was a poorly made game and it\'s boring who wants to sit forever for lives than just waist them by failing it will make u feel like a complete lose people might say it\'s great but it\'s only when there good at it...so don\'t get the game\360\237\230\240\360\237\230\262"

    comment: "Level 5 is incredibly difficult to beat. Please lower the requirement to get an S to 90. Also it\'s very very stupid to lower the requirements to get a level 3 or 4 or 5 if you won\'t lower them all. It just doesn\'t make any sense"
