    title: "Boring and seemingly psychic AI."
    comment: "No way to turn off the animations which is really annoying considering the ai seems to know exactly where you\'ve placed all your ships, and maybe moves theirs around during the game.  I\'d rather lose in 10 seconds than wait for the ai to destroy four ships in one \"lucky\" turn. Uninstalled and not considered for future downloads."

    title: "Never been able to fight IOS people"
    comment: "On multiple phones selecting \"only ios opponent\" will lead to an endless wait. Placement phase is clumsy as well. The ships being directly under the finger means that i cannot see properly when placing. It would be nice to undo a single weapon placement too without resetting the whole arsenal. When you only have two minutes to do placement one weapon mistake can upset all the battle plan because there might be no time to reset."

    comment: "I love it except for that my app stopped working suddenly, it worked fine then today it wouldn\'t go past the main menu. The screen didn\'t recognize my touch at all. All of my other apps did though, I reinstalled it and it worked then I closed the app and came back to play it again and the same thing happened. Please do fix this bug because I love, love, love this game!! Takes me back to my childhood days a little bit. :)"
