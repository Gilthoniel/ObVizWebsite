    comment: "Game crashes on startup if wifi is On. So I turn it on once game is started. Next to Keep progressing you need Gems to level up magic. But it crashes after every ad to get free Gems yet Some how work when they randomly put an ad up after a fight. Sent many crash reports and an e-mail or two and no rresponse."

    title: "Elegant graphics and quite interesting story, BUT..."
    comment: "I love your game and the story line in it ... your only problem that you take very long time to release these new chapters which is boring ... Im waiting for the next update over 3 monthes I think which is looong time. UPDATE: after waiting for the update all this time, I\'m very disappointed ... the update contains one extra mission and some weapons only !!! So thats it !!! Where is chapter 3 ... where is the rest of the story guys?!!!"

    comment: "Lovely game. However, i am afraid of making in app purchases since it takes my money and doesn\'t give me value for it. On the 15th of June 2015, i purchased gold for $1.92 and the money was taken from my account. 2 days later, i still don\'t have value for my money. No gold. You may wish to give me value or a refund. sort it out and this gets 5 stars. My game user ID is 46 503 451.  Again, I will not make any further purchase until this is sorted."

    comment: "I have given it a 3 star becoz this is a nice game but now I am very disappointed . I have spent 3.5 months on this game to defeat all bodyguards , completed all challenges, all bosses but after all this what I got,  a repeat to the start itself . It shows as if I hadn\'t done anything in the game and now I am again at the start . I don\'t believe if I play the game again , it will get completed or it will again get in the loop. Sorry I am uninstalling it. Nice game but its over now."
