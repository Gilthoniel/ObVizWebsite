    title: "Need a big change"
    comment: "The game need a big change I\'m sorry to say but I think ya don\'t care what people say you just update the game and make it must worse. I recommend changing a lot of things from pixel gun, the survival earning system, all files being given from game like the skins files and etc, the gems being switch to only coins, magic weapons being infinite and the report system. If you want to make this game better than bring back some stuff stop making it worse for players to play.  They gonna stop playing at some point"

    title: "Things need improving"
    comment: "This game actually is pretty awesome, for a free game it plays very close to a console version of a shooter , the only problem I have with it is the coins you earn. You literally earn a coin per match and you don\'t even get coins if your team loses so that blows ( guns are range from 80-300 coins so your gonna be playing a lot until your next upgrade) change this and I will never uninstall lol if not changed I might find a different game to play that is more balanced"

    comment: "People seem to be complaining about things that are their own fault/problem. Example: People are complaining about what other people are saying in chat. In the settings there is a button you can press to turn off chat. Also, some people complain about the campaign mode being too hard. If they are bad at the game that\'s not RiliSoft\'s fault. People nowadays are just so lazy that they can\'t spend a little while working for what they want. Oh, and I have no idea why it is rated Teen."

    title: "Rilisoft I have an idea"
    comment: "Many players think about earning gems faster. So, I think you should add achievements that give you a small amount of gems for each completion. Such as this one for example: \"Let\'s not lose our heads\" Headshot 20 players from a long distance, reward: 3 gem\'s.I think this would cause more people to play which would give a point to playing the game. I hope you consider this. Thanks for listening"

    title: "Fix"
    comment: "I love the new campaign but the difficulty spike is way to hard. I had a fun time at swamp and castle. Space was so confusing, but what takes the cake is mega block city. The enemy\'s spawn is so random and they rack up to much damage too quickly, especially when you have to reload. There is not enough ammo, armor, health, and the whole level just feels like it was quickly slapped together."
