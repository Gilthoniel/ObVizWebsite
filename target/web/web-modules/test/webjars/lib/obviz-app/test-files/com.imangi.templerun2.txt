    comment: "The original characters should be free of charge and the limited edition characters should cost like 2500 and not some extravagant price that the players can\'t buy because by the time they have enough money to buy it the limited time is up                                       another thing is the achievements should not be by level the should be on a list and every time we achieve one we get rewards for them"

    comment: "I have the new LG g3, with the new lollipop 5.0 update. Temple run 2 is extremely glitchy, no obstacles pop up, leaving the character to run without dying. Then the character will spontaneously die, spawning me to 63,000 yards, in the water. Please fix. I really enjoyed this app on my old phone."

    title: "Beyond Level 10"
    comment: "A very nice and splendid game app. The only challenge I have with it is that I am stuck right after Level TEN. I thought after finishing all the tasks up to the 10th level, the next level, Eleven, would initialize with its own tasks. Unfortunately, Level 11 is up but its tray is empty of tasks. Is this a general phenomenon? Is this everybody\'s experience??"

    title: "Needs to be harder"
    comment: "Although I agree with there being a bug after you reach about 75,000,000 the game starts lagging like crazy on S5. I also think you should make the game harder and stop giving things once earned away for free. Also more abilities and upgrades.  I\'ve unlocked all artifacts, power ups, chactors, and abilities. Have Coins with no use besides head starts."

    comment: "I went to play the game on my phone and it had reset. I had zero coins. Zero gems. I was back to level one. No characters were unlocked. None of the powers were upgraded. I went from level 9 with 300 something gems and 37,000 coins and almost everything upgraded and a 60day streak in daily challenges to nothing."
