    title: "Too hard to upgrade"
    comment: "Awesome game. But it takes hours and hours to get enough coins/diamonds to buy a new weapon. If you wanna buy coins with real life money its ridiculous!! $24.99 to get 120 thousand coins. Which is only enough for a tier 4 gun. Like I said, awesome game but the increments at which you can upgrade are so far off."

    title: "Small Valleys Daily Mission 4"
    comment: "**updated**  I appreciate the attempt to fix this but now you cannot access the daily mission at all. **  Cannot do this mission because it is flawed.  None of the bad guys show up.  The game says mission failed because they got close to you (misspelled in the description by the way), but nobody ever appears. At one point you can catch a glimpse of a guy in the middle of the square but gone in a flash.  Game glitch needs to be fixed."

    title: "Fantastic game, Until now!"
    comment: "Dear Devs,  i absolutely love this game, but after this update & updating my device to lollipop, i couldn\'t restore my weapons and game progress. I had finished all missions, including special ops of Martinville. Now i have to play the game all over again, this happened twice. This is no longer fun :-( :-( Kindly look into the matter. I would love to continue playing this game."

    comment: "The first three levels made me think this game would be fun, but it would not let me get beyond the buy your own weapon screen. The game just freezes there."

    comment: "didnt think anything especial until i downed my first kill, animation and sound effects are well liked by me and my friends, can there be any cooperative missions??? however, lately its been crashing and i had to reinstall it, i lost my guns and gold... its still worth to do again but just too damn hard to upgrade let alone earn enough..."

    comment: "Well, after some power up buttons bugging my hunting time, now i found some even more annoying bugs. 1). Some missions on warehouse cleaning still continues even after i wiped them ALL. I tried it more than 3 times with sacrificing my power up (revealing target), but the result still the same, times up but no one to be shot. In the end i skipped the mission by letting 2k of coin gone away. 2). Another bug is, in a mission i cannot shoot the yellow barrels! I SAW 4 yellow barrells, yes they were there, but they cannot be shot! Is that mean i have to clean 14 thugs in less than 5 seconds before i get shot? Come on guys.... Please fix them out."

    title: "Addictive but frustrating"
    comment: "Game starts off well, but missions are a little repetitive when you get 3/4 of the way through 2nd mission area the game starts to lock up with you not being able to aim or fire an charicters stuck in an infinite loop. The weapons are redicularly high prices and the missions have little reward which you end up using to upgrade the low level rifle you have in your arsenal. Over all this is a good game a few fixes  and slightly higher rewards and it could be a great game."

    comment: "Its a good concept of a game however it is ruined because it constantly is obviously begging you for to buy upgrades. That it self is so annoying that I will probably delete the app. Now I have spent about 150 on clash of clans but it doesn\'t beg for money. It simply challenges you till you want to spend the money. Hopefully they will improve this or another developer will build another app that gets you involved to where you want to spend the cash."
