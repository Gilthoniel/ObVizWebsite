    comment: "The only thing I don\'t like is when you get your free gift and you put it in the gift machine, you don\'t always get different characters, like sometimes it says \"Sorry try again\" because you go the same one"

    comment: "I like this game because you don\'t have to pay to win. I enjoyed getting little achievements, getting free gifts every few hours, and the many characters you can try to get. I don\'t feel the need to play constantly but there always seems to be more to unlock."
