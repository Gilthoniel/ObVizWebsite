    title: "Please don\'t make me play that again"
    comment: "This game is just plain boring. It loaded quickly and ran well on my HTC One M9, will no lag spikes or stutters. My biggest problem is the controls; the punching and kicking animation takes so long that it\'s nearly impossible to kill someone unless they\'re standing still, if you can even find an NPC! I managed to find two; one police officer that I killed with no consequences, and one civilian who bolted away from me. This game needs some serious polishing."

    title: "**Lags and Crashes**"
    comment: "This game lags terribly, it lags so bad that you can\'t control him walking let alone driving! After 1 or 2 minutes the game crashes then it tries to reload it self and crashes over and over. The idea of this game (from the small part that I was able to play) is awesome! I would love to play this game! I think this could be a great game / app. Please fix the lagging and the continual crashes, and I will be able to give this app a better rating and recommend this game to other friends and family."

    title: "Sucks"
    comment: "Controls are terrible, the graphics were awful, attacks were idiotic, driving the cars was awful, I tried to ram the car in a police officer and all that did just pushed him in the building and he just kept shooting at me and I couldn\'t even get to him! Another is why do they have health bars? Why do we not get any guns to begin with or at least find? Where the hell is the people? Why are there these idiotic levels? WHY DOES A CAR THAT RAMS A GUY GET A SMALL AMOUNT OF DAMAGE WHILE A KICK CAUSES A LOT OF HEA"

    title: "Get over yourselves, it\'s free"
    comment: "No one made you play it to begin with. This is why no one likes whiny kids and adults. The game is free. Sure it lacks functions and features you might expect from popular titles but for a game that\'s less than 50mb and didn\'t put a dent in my cell plan\'s bandwidth, I can\'t complain. I found several npc with light searching as well as a bike and a car. The handling is very basic and you can flip the sports car but you shouldn\'t be expecting a $7 race game. The police do retaliate btw."

    comment: "Would rate the game better if my car doesn\'t run away from me after I get off and flip over after few turns, needs better control, punching n kicking can\'t really kill unless they just stands still and police shoots u out of nowhere"

    title: "Super glitchy"
    comment: "Locks onto targets and makes you run at them even if youre trying to escape from them. Running into a target can cause them to phase through walls. Targets can run through fences and brick walls. \"levels\" are boring. Come up with better mission goals. Good platform, poor implementation."

    title: "Needs a bit of work"
    comment: "Interface is edgy and the NPC spawn rate is too low for the missions. Some minor bugs when firing weapons, the aim jerks left or right. Other then that, its pretty much an accurate portrayal of the black guy white guy foot race haha. Cars flip in any 90\302\260 turn or more, handling isn\'t much better. Just needs some work guys. Sand box it on source forge, you\'ll be surprised at the feedback and other programmers that will help."
