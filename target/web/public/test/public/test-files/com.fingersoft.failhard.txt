    comment: "Great game it\'s simple and fun the only thing I would change is make it a bit less expensive coin wise or make some of the coins worth more.  But otherwise awesome and I\'m gonna keep playing"

    comment: "I think the title says it all. I had a good time playing this game which satisfied my craves as I was looking for a nice game to play for quite a while. Great graphics and very good marketing ideas that don\'t get into my nerves but provide support to the player and the company to keep the good work up!"

    title: "Fun, challenging, entertainment"
    comment: "This is a neat game for all ages, and is humorous to boot. The coins aren\'t too hard to gather, lots of environments to pick from. My one gripe is that on the third run of a level, the dirt bike performs VERY poorly, I am not sure why this is. Hopefully it will be fixed in future updates! Recommendation: download over WiFi, it takes a while!"

    comment: "Decent little game..no need to pay any extra as coins come fairly easily. A bit more variety wouldn\'t go a miss in later levels but passes the time nicely on the bus to work."

    title: "Beast gamer"
    comment: "I believe that it is a great addictive game. The only problem I am encountering is a certain lag once so many levels in. This is the same with several games I have downloaded on my android device. In saying that, it may have nothing to do with the game, great. If so, that bug needs to be taken care of.  I enjoy this game and it is a great 3D time passer. Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do. A must to download. Thanks for the great game and free coins."
