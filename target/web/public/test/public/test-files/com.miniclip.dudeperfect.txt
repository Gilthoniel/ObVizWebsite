    comment: "Isn\'t the purpose of developing a game to get people to play it? It was getting ridiculous with the energy stuff and all the paid 2 unlocks. Pls remove some of these things to get 5 stars."

    title: "Awesome game, but forces you to wait for energy to keep playing, or OFCOURSE you can buy more time."
    comment: "Awesome game, but just about to uninstall because of the pointless energy bars they make you buy if you want to keep playing. There\'s no reason to force us to buy crap when you already have pop-up ads...."

    comment: "Would be 5 stars if it didn\'t crash so much. Super fun and addicting though. Everyone is complaining of the energy bar but I don\'t see it as a big deal. Already 3 stars on every level. Can\'t wait for the next update!"

    title: "Great but not."
    comment: "I loved the game until I made it to level 49. I CANNOT make the bowling ball go up to the height it is supposed to. I\'ve tried angling it in ever possible way, I\'ve even used the guideline power-up to assist me and it still won\'t go in the wooden box."

    comment: "Can\'t wait for level 100 and up. It a really cool game. If I could make an adjustment I would let the energy bars hold longer and let you build your own challenging levels to play against yourself."

    comment: "Very addictive. But too difficult to get 3 stars for 90% of the levels. Would be nice if we can unlock further levels with lesser stars."

    title: "It\'s ok"
    comment: "The app is playable but it is nothing compared to the other app they have made... it takes too long to go to \"map\" to \"map\" and I don\'t like how you aim up your shot then you have to repush the basketball button for it to shoot... I personally liked the other way where you would aim it up and then as soon as you let go it shot the ball."

    title: "ENERGY???"
    comment: "Why does every game put a limit on how much you can play it? Does this make sense to anyone? The game is so much fun, but the limited energy problem is what is stopping me from rating it 5 stars. So, please (maker of this game), get rid of the stupid energy bars. I doubt anyone would pay the full $9 for unlimited energy."

    comment: "This is a very cool game but I don\'t like the fact that you have to get so many stars to unlock the next group. I\'m not a big gamer so having to try over and over to get to the next group after I\'ve made it thru a group sucks."
