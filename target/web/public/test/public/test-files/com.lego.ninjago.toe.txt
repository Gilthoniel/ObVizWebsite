    title: "Way too easy"
    comment: "This game is not worth installing as the only thing you need to do is spam attack. Wave after wave of the same enemies (just more and more per wave). Its so hard to die that you can, basiclly,  stand still and let the bomb-throwing dudes throw bombs at the enemies around you to gain HP. I can understand that this might have been developed for an younger audience but that doesnt change the fact that this is a crappy game, what a coincident, I\'m on the crapper right now!"

    title: "Awesome, but..."
    comment: "This game is great! But there is one problem, after you get to a high enougth stage, there are TONS of enemies, you may think that sounds hard, but you defeat so many that you\'re charge attack goes up in a few seconds! Can you make it so that as you progress, it takes more defeated enemies to charge up the special attack?"
