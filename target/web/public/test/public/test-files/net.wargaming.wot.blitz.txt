    comment: "It\'s not like the makers read this. Anyway, lots of bugs since download. I\'ve been in battle. Then kicked out of that battle 1 min in and back to the garage. I\'ve also been in a battle where 5 of 7 players on my team couldn\'t see the enemy. Me being one of them."

    comment: "I\'m not having any issues on the update. I haven\'t seen any bugs or had any crashes. As far as invisible tanks. I hope your aware certain tanks get bonus to not being detected, especially Tank Destroyers and Scouts. And people complaining about \"not being able to hit A higher tier\" , some tanks have better armor which means you have to know where there weak spots are. This has got to be the best game on Android, the only game that come anywhere close to A PC game with really good gfx and good physics combin"

    title: "Players feel stuck"
    comment: "I have M3 Lee tank with Blue star 18000, with silver coins 2.5L there is discount on Pz. III/IV still it says I can\'t buy this tank. again blue star are for individual tanks not accumulated one fig. For players experience. On total of 4 tanks its 75k points, which is worthless as don\'t have any upgrades left in the same tier. And I am unable to buy tanks from other flags with thoes blue stars. Making complex of having XP then blue stars then golden stars then silver coins and last golden coins."

    title: "Awesome game, but..."
    comment: "Latest update full of bugs/force close, cannot even load game. FIX. The constant uneven matchups in the higher tiers takes all the fun out of it!!! Put tier 5 tanks against other 5, not 8 where I can\'t even get a fair shot in against them. This would be an easy fix. Also fix range finder."

    comment: "Since last update, It keeps force stop and froze for a second in some battle then kick me out of the battle but I can use the tank that I just use in that battle. Many of the battle we can\'t see the enemy team but they can see us or the other way around. Also sometimes both side are invisible. Fix it please."

    comment: "Like the new map i got booted from (without even shooting at least 5 times) and the last 9 games im getting slapped by \"ghost tanks\" Its getting to the point im really wanting to snap my phone. What do i get as a sorry?? If its fixed i will up the rating. Update:- still a couple of bugs (loose control of the tank and still get booted) but on a whole im happy. Thank you"

    comment: "There is probably no ghost tanks. They just have a better view range than you for distances. So if your getting killed from distances, sorry guys but, it just means they ave a better tank. Btw love this game, for a free game? This is a amazeing one. Definitely 5 stars."
